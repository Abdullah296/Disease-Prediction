# Disease-Prediction
  Make a class of Baysain inference which you can import it in your own code
  Make another File to use the above file functions
 Class has following functions
 *  .Clean (which find all NAN in data and drop that row from whole Data).
 *  .Train (which Find the probabilities of all Disease given following Symptoms )
 *  .predict(Which tell the Disease having greater Probability)



| Disease    | Total | Fever   ||Tastelessness | Fatigue   |
| :---        |    :----:   |          ---: |:----:   |          ---: |
|Corona     | 116       | 95   |49       |81   |
| viral Infection   | 26        | 11      |2       | 7   |
